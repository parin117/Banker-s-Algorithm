# 🏦 Banker's Algorithm Simulator

A simple, interactive web app to visualize and understand the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in Operating Systems.

## ✨ Features
- Simulates both **Safety** and **Resource Request** algorithms
- Step-by-step safe sequence detection
- Easy input for processes and resources
- Visual, user-friendly interface (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap)
- No installation needed—just open in your browser!

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone or Download** this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. Enter the number of processes and resources
2. Click **Generate Tables**
3. Fill in the allocation and maximum matrices
4. Click **Generate Available & Need Matrix**
5. Click **Find Safe Sequence** to see if the system is in a safe state
6. (Optional) Test resource requests and validate them

## 📚 About Banker's Algorithm
The Banker's Algorithm is a classic deadlock avoidance algorithm. It checks if resource allocation leaves the system in a safe state, preventing deadlocks before they happen.
